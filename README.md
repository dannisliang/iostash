About
-----
ioStash is a completely hackable advanced IoT eco system unlike any other, featuring data mining from the collected data, real-time multi channel data streaming, easy access to data API's, remote configuration of hardware modules and more.

ioStash eco system consists of an open IoT module with built in Wifi (and/or ethernet), I/O pin host, built in battery and a cloud based data repository to collect data. Any number of IoT Modules can be used to segregate and process data from multiple locations. Requiring minimum effort to configure and starting up within minutes, Yes you heard it right, minutes! ioStash is the perfect solution to those wasted hours on setting up and configuring.

How is this different from x ?
-----
ioStash is a full fledged IoT eco system with a hardware data logger and a cloud based dashboard. The hardware part of ioStash is powerful enough to sample 3 analog and 3 digital signals simultaneously and also supports sensors using I2C and SPI communication protocols.

ioStash dashboard lets you analyze and re-stream data to multiple channels and also lets you configure your hardware remotely. It even lets you find complex patterns and anomalies from your data!

The best part is, ioStash is cheap! Infact, it is the cheapest IoT platform on the planet!

Current State
